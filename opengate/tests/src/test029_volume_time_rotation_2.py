    WARNING when "angle_acceptance_volume" is enabled, it is a bit faster (+50%) but the result is not
    exactly the same as without. This is because, even if the initial particle is not in the direction of
    the spect system, it can scatter and still reach the detector.

    We don't have the collimator here (to accelerate the simulation), this is why the difference is not negligible.

    The (fake) reference is computed by scaling the ref by 90% (test029_volume_time_rotation_1.py)
