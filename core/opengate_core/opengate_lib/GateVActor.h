   ************ WARNING ************

   * In multi-thread mode, there is (for the moment) a single actor object
   shared
   * by all threads. It means it is **required** to use mutex when modifying a
   * local variable. An alternative is to set all thread modifiable variables in
   * a thread_local structure with G4Cache<my_struct> (see for example in
   * G4SingleParticleSource). And merge at the end. (see
   * GateSimulationStatisticsActor). The second should be faster, but I did not
   * really test.
   *
   * Another alternative is to use G4VAccumulable (not fully clear how/when to
   * call Merge() however).
   *
   * Last alternative -> change python side to create one actor for each thread.
   * It takes more memory, but could be potentially faster (no lock).
   *
   * ... We left this as exercise for the reader ;)
