From GATE 9 to 10: Intro
************************

If you are a long standing user of GATE, you will likely have multiple nicely set up simulations with several mac files and scripts working together to make your simulation work. And you will likely sit there and say to yourself: How on earth will I convert all this stuff to GATE 10?

The feedback from people who have switched to GATE 10 over a year ago already is: It's easier than it seems and actually quite enjoyable. This part of the user guide is supposed to help you with the migration task. The idea is simple: We (as a GATE community) collect examples of simulations that have been converted from GATE 9 to 10. The longer the collection, the more likely you will find something familiar. And while you convert your simulation, you automatically learn how to use GATE 10 - nice.

So once you have tackled your first conversion, please give back to the community and share your set of mac files and python script to let this collection grow.

Ah, one last remark: Many have asked us if there will be a conversion tool to migrate from GATE 9 to GATE 10. Probably not. It is pretty tricky to get such a tool to work properly and frustrating if it doesn't. Therefore, we think that a good collection of examples is actually more helpful. And who knows, maybe some LLM will learn how to convert our simulations at some point.
