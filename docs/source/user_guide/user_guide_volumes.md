# Geometry and volumes

Gate fundamentally relies on the geometry principles of Geant4, but provides the user with an easy-to-use interface to set up the geometry of a simulation.
In this part of the Gate user guide, we explain how a simulation geometry is set up in Gate.

Under the hood, geometry is handled and parametrized by Geant4. GATE just sets it up for you. Therefore, it might be worthwhile looking at the [Geant4 user guide](http://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/geant4-userdoc/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/Detector/Geometry/geomSolids.html#constructed-solid-geometry-csg-solids) as well.

Volumes are the components that make up the simulation geometry. Following Geant4 logic, a volume contains information about its shape, its placement in space, its material, and possibly settings about physics modeling within that volume. In Gate, all these properties are stored and handled in a single volume object, e.g. a `BoxVolume`, `SphereVolume`, `ImageVolume`.

## Create a volume

Volumes are managed by the VolumeManager and can be created in two ways:

1) ... with the `add_volume` command, providing the type of  volume as string argument. It is mandatory to provide a unique name as well. A volume is created according to the specified volume type and the volume object is returned. Example:

```python
import opengate as gate
sim = gate.Simulation()
myboxvol = sim.add_volume('Box', name='mybox')
```
Most users will opt for this way of creating volumes.

2) ... by calling the volume class. In this case, the volume is created, but not yet added to the simulation. It has to be added to the simulation explicitly.
Example:

```python
import opengate as gate
sim = gate.Simulation()
myspherevol = gate.geometry.volumes.SphereVolume(name='mysphere')
sim.add_volume(myspherevol)
```
This second way of creating volumes is useful in cases where the volume is needed but should not be part of the simulation. For example, if it serves as basis for a [boolean operation](#boolean-volumes), e.g. to be intersected with another volume.

Note that the `add_volume` command in the second example does not require the `name` because the volume already exists and already has a name. For the same reason, the `add_volume` command does not return anything, i.e. it returns `None`.

Note: Every simulation has a default volume called `world` (lowercase) which is automatically created.

## Set the parameters of a volume

The parameters of a volume can be set as follows:

```python
import opengate as gate
sim = gate.Simulation()
vol = sim.add_volume('Box', 'mybox')
vol.material = 'G4_AIR'
vol.mother = 'world'  # by default
cm = gate.g4_units.cm
mm = gate.g4_units.mm
vol.size = [10 * cm, 5 * cm, 15 * mm]
```

Use `print` to get an overview of all the parameters of a volume:

```python
print(vol)
```

In an interactive python console, e.g. ipython, you can also type `help(vol)` to get an explanation of the parameters.

To dump a list of all available volume types:

```python
print('Volume types :')
print(sim.volume_manager.dump_volume_types())
```

## Volume hierarchy

All volumes have a parameter `mother` which contains the name of the volume to which they are attached. You can also pass a volume object to the `mother` parameter and Gate will extract its name from it. By default, a volume's mother is the world volume (which has the name `world`). Gate creates a hierarchy of volumes based on each volume's `mother` parameter, according to Geant4's logic of hierarchically nested volumes. The volume hierarchy can be inspected with the command `dump_volume_tree` of the volume manager. Example:

```python
import opengate as gate
sim = gate.Simulation
b1 = sim.add_volume('Box', name='b1')
b1_a = sim.add_volume('Box', name='b1_a')
b1_b = sim.add_volume('Box', name='b1_b')
b1_a.mother = b1
b1_b.mother = b1
sim.volume_manager.dump_volume_tree()
```

Take a look at `test007` as example for simple volumes.


## Utility properties

Volume objects come with several properties which allow you to extract information about the volume. The following description assumes that you have created a volume already, i.e.

```python
import opengate as gate
sim = gate.Simulation()
mysphere = sim.add_volume('SphereVolume', name='mysphere')
```

You can use the following properties to obtain information about the volume `mysphere`:
- `mysphere.volume_depth_in_tree`: this yields the depth in the hierarchy tree of volumes where *0* is the world, *1* is a volume attached to the world, *2* the first-level subvolume of another volume, and so forth.
- `mysphere.world_volume`: returns the world volume to which this volume is linked through the volume hierarchy. Useful in a simulation with [parallel worlds](#parallel-worlds).
- `mysphere.volume_type`: returns the volume type, e.g. "BoxVolume", "BooleanVolume", "ImageVolume". Technically speaking, it yields the name of the volume's class.
- `mysphere.bounding_limits`: returns the corner coordinates (3 element list: (x,y,z)) of the bounding box of the volume
- `mysphere.bounding_box_size`: returns the size of the bounding box along x, y, z

Note that the above properties are read-only - you cannot set their values.

## Materials

From the simulation point of view, a material is a set of parameters describing its chemical composition and physical properties such as its density.

Geant4 defines a set of default materials which are also available in GATE. A prominent example is "G4_WATER".
The full list of Geant4 materials is available [here](https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/Appendix/materialNames.html).

On top of that, Gate provides different mechanisms to define additional materials. One option is via a text file which can be loaded with

```python
sim.volume_manager.add_material_database("GateMaterials.db")
```

All material names defined in the "GateMaterials.db" can then be used for any volume. Please check the file in `tests/data/GateMaterials.db` for the required format of database file.

<!--
Alternatively, materials can be created within a simulation script with the following command:

```python
import opengate
gate.volume_manager.new_material("mylar", 1.38 * gcm3, ["H", "C", "O"], [0.04196, 0.625016, 0.333024])
```

This function creates a material named "mylar", with the given mass density and the composition (H C and O here) described as a vector of percentages. Note that the weights are normalized. The created material can then be used for any volume.
-->

## Parallel worlds

## Examples of complex geometries: Linac, SPECT, PET, phantoms

Examples of complex nested geometries, partly relying on boolean and repeat operations, can be found in the subpackages `opengate.contrib.pet`,  `opengate.contrib.spect`, `opengate.contrib.linacs`, `opengate.contrib.phantoms`. Also have a look at some of the tests that use these geometries, e.g. `test015` (iec phantom), `test019` (linac Elekta), `test028` (SPECT GE NM670), `test037` (Philips Vereos PET).
