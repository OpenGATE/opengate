Details: Sources
****************

Common parameters
=================

Sources are the objects that create particles *ex nihilo*. The particles
created from sources are called the *Event* in the Geant4 terminology,
they got a *EventID* which is unique in a given *Run*.

Several sources can be defined and are managed at the same time. To add
a source description to the simulation, you do:

.. code:: python

   source1 = sim.add_source('GenericSource', 'source1')
   source1.n = 100

   source2 = sim.add_source('VoxelSource', 'source2')
   source2.activity = 10 * g4_units.Bq

There are several source types, each one with different parameter. In
this example, ``source1.n`` indicates that this source will generate 100
Events. The second source manages the time and will generate 10 Events
per second, so according to the simulation run timing, a different
number of Events will be generated.

Information about the sources may be displayed with:

.. code:: python

   # Print all types of source
   print(sim.dump_source_types())

   # Print information about all sources
   print(sim.dump_sources())

Some of the parameters are common to **all** types of sources, while others
are specific to a certain type of source.
Given a source ``source``, use ``print(source)`` to display the
source's parameters and their default values.

Common parameters are:

* | ``attached_to``: the name of the volume to which the source is attached (``world`` by default) in the hierarchy of volumes.
  | See :ref:`geometry-and-volumes` for more details.
* | ``position.translation``: list of 2 numerical values, e.g. ``[0, 2 * cm, 3 * mm]``.
  | It defines the translation of the source with respect to the reference frame of the attached volume.
  | Note: the origin of the reference frame is always at the center of the shape in Geant4.
* | ``rotation``: a 3×3 rotation matrix.
  | Rotation of the volume with respect to the attached volume.
  | We advocate the use of `scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation` to manage the rotation matrix.
* | ``n``: the number (integer) of particles to emit (the number of Geant4 Events).
* | ``activity``: the number (real, in Bq) of particle to emit per second.
  | The number of Geant4 Events will depend on the simulation time.


Coordinate system
-----------------

The :attr:`~.opengate.sources.base.SourceBase.attached_to` option indicates the coordinate system of the source. By
default, it is the world, but it is possible to attach a source to any
volume. In that case, the coordinate system of all emitted particles
will follow the given volume.
Using ``source.direction_relative_to_attached_volume = True`` will make
your source direction change following the rotation of that volume.

Generic source
==============

Description
-----------

The most commonly used type of source is called ''GenericSource''. It can be used to
describe a large range of simple source types. With ‘GenericSource’,
user must describe 1) particle type, 2) position, 3) direction and 4)
energy, see the following example:

.. code:: python

   from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation  # used to describe a rotation matrix

   MeV = gate.g4_units('MeV')
   Bq = gate.g4_units('Bq')
   source = sim.add_source('GenericSource', 'mysource')
   source.attached_to = 'my_volume'
   source.particle = 'proton'
   source.activity = 10000 * Bq
   source.position.type = 'box'
   source.position.dimension = [4 * cm, 4 * cm, 4 * cm]
   source.position.translation = [-3 * cm, -3 * cm, -3 * cm]
   source.position.rotation = Rotation.from_euler('x', 45, degrees=True).as_matrix()
   source.direction.type = 'iso'
   source.energy.type = 'gauss'
   source.energy.mono = 80 * MeV
   source.energy.sigma_gauss = 1 * MeV

All parameters are stored into a dict-like structure (a Box). Particle
can be ‘gamma’, ‘e+’, ‘e-’, ‘proton’ (all Geant4 names). The number of
particles that will be generated by the source can be described by an
activity ``source.activity = 10 * MBq`` or by a number of particle
``source.n = 100``.

The positions from where the particles will be generated are defined by a
shape (‘box’, ‘sphere’, ‘point’, ‘disc’), defined by several parameters
(‘size’, ‘radius’) and orientation (‘rotation’, ‘center’). The direction
are defined with ‘iso’, ‘momentum’, ‘focused’ and ‘histogram’. The energy
can be defined by a single value (‘mono’) or Gaussian (‘gauss’).


.. _source-particle-type:
Particle type
-------------

The particle type can be set to any valid Geant4 name
(e.g. ``"gamma"``, ``"e+"``, ``"e-"``", ``"proton"``):

.. code:: python

   source.particle = "gamma"

It is also possible to use ions with the key word "ion" followed by Z and A.
Source of ion can be set with the following (see ``test013``):

.. code:: python

   source1 = sim.add_source('GenericSource, 'ion1')
   source1.particle = 'ion 9 18'  # Fluorine18
   source2 = sim.add_source('GenericSource, 'ion2')
   source2.particle = 'ion 53 124'  # Iodine 124


Source of ion can be set with the following (see ``test013``)

.. code:: python

   source1 = sim.add_source('GenericSource, 'ion1')
   source1.particle = 'ion 9 18'  # Fluorine18
   source2 = sim.add_source('GenericSource, 'ion2')
   source2.particle = 'ion 53 124'  # Iodine 124


.. _source-position:
Particle initial position
-------------------------

The positions from were the particles will be generated are defined by a shape
(e.g. "point", "box", "sphere", "disc"), defined by several parameters ("size", "radius")
and orientation ("rotation", "center").
A translation relative to the ``attached_to`` volume can also be set.

Here are some examples (mostly from ``test010_generic_source.py``):

.. code:: python

    source.position.type = "point"
    source.position.translation = [0 * cm, 0 * cm, -30 * cm]


.. code:: python

    source.position.type = "sphere"
    source.position.radius = 5 * mm
    source.position.translation = [-3 * cm, 30 * cm, -3 * cm]


.. code:: python

    source.position.type = "disc"
    source.position.radius = 5 * mm
    source.position.translation = [6 * cm, 5 * cm, -30 * cm]


.. code:: python

    source.position.type = "box"
    source.position.size = [4 * cm, 4 * cm, 4 * cm]
    source.position.translation = [8 * cm, 8 * cm, 30 * cm]


.. _source-direction:
Particle initial direction
--------------------------

-  ``direction.type = 'iso'`` assigns directions to primary particles
   based on 𝜃 and 𝜙 angles in a `spherical coordinate system
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system>`__.
   By default, 𝜃 varies from 0° to 180° and 𝜙 varies from 0° to 360°
   (such that any direction is possible). You can define the 𝜃 and 𝜙
   ranges with minimum and maximum values as follows:

   .. code:: python

      source.direction.type = "iso"
      source.direction.theta = [0, 10 * deg]
      source.direction.phi = [0, 90 * deg]


``direction.type = "iso"`` assigns directions to primary particles
based on 𝜃 and 𝜙 angles in a `spherical coordinate system
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system>`__.
By default, 𝜃 varies from 0° to 180° and 𝜙 varies from 0° to 360°
(such that any direction is possible). You can define the 𝜃 and 𝜙
ranges with minimum and maximum values as follows:

.. code:: python

    source.direction.type = "iso"
    source.direction.theta = [0, 10 * deg]
    source.direction.phi = [0, 90 * deg]


Geant4 defines the direction as: - x = -sin𝜃 cos𝜙; - y = -sin𝜃 sin𝜙; - z
= -cos𝜃.

So 𝜃 is the angle in XOZ plane, from -Z to -X; and 𝜙 is the angle in XOY
plane from -X to -Y.

.. image:: ../figures/thetaphi.png
   :width: 70%
   :align: center



-  ``direction.type = 'momentum'`` specifies a fixed direction for the
   primary particles using a momentum vector [x, y, z].

   .. code:: python

      source.direction.type = "momentum"
      source.direction.momentum = [0,0,1]

-  ``direction.type = 'focused'`` configures the primary particles to be
   emitted such that they converge towards a specified focus point. The
   focus point is set using a coordinate array [x, y, z] that defines its
   position.

   .. code:: python

      source.position.type = "disc"
      source.position.radius = 2 * cm
      source.direction.type = "focused"
      source.direction.focus_point = [1 * cm, 2 * cm, 3 * cm]

-  ``direction.type = 'histogram'``, same as ``'iso'``, but allows you
   to emit primary particles with directional distributions weighted by
   custom-defined histograms for 𝜃 (theta) and 𝜙 (phi) angles.

   .. code:: python

      source.direction.type = "histogram"
      source.direction.histogram_theta_weights = [1]
      source.direction.histogram_theta_angles = [80 * deg, 100 * deg]
      source.direction.histogram_phi_weights = [0.3, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 0.3]
      source.direction.histogram_phi_angles = [ 60 * deg, 70 * deg, 80 * deg, 100 * deg, 110 * deg, 120 * deg]

See figure below, left:

.. code:: python

    # Example A
    source.direction.type = "histogram"
    source.direction.histogram_phi_angle = [70 * deg, 110 * deg]
    source.direction.histogram_phi_weight = [0, 1]


See figure below, right:

.. code:: python

    # Example B
    source.direction.type = "histogram"
    source.direction.histogram_phi_angle = [70 * deg, 80 * deg, 90* deg, 100 * deg, 110 * deg]
    source.direction.histogram_phi_weight = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

   :width: 49.6%


.. image:: ../figures/generic_source_direction_histogram_b.png
   :width: 49.6%


Using ``source.direction_relative_to_attached_volume = True`` will make
your source direction change following the rotation of that volume.



Acceptance Angle
----------------

It is possible to indicate an ``angle_acceptance_volume`` to the
direction of a source. In that case, the particle will be created only
if their position & direction make them intersect the given volume. This
is for example useful for SPECT imaging in order to limit the particle
creation to the ones that will have a chance to reach the detector. Note
that the particles that will not intersect the volume will be created
anyway but with a zero energy (so not tracked). This mechanism ensures
to remain consistent with the required activity and timestamps of the
particles, there is no need to scale with the solid angle. See for
example ``test028`` test files for more details.

Geant4 defines the direction as: - x = -sin𝜃 cos𝜙; - y = -sin𝜃 sin𝜙; - z
= -cos𝜃.

So 𝜃 is the angle in XOZ plane, from -Z to -X; and 𝜙 is the angle in XOY
plane from -X to -Y.

.. image:: ../figures/thetaphi.png


Half-life
---------

You can instruct GATE to decrease the activity according to an exponential
decay by setting the parameter :attr:`~.opengate.sources.base.SourceBase.half_life`. Exmaple:

.. code-block:: python

    source = sim.add_source('GenericSource, 'mysource')
    source.half_life = 60 * gate.g4_units.s

.. autoproperty:: opengate.sources.generic.GenericSource.half_life

Time Activity Curves (TAC)
--------------------------

Alternatively, user can provide a TAC (Time Activity Curve) by means of
two vectors (times and activities):

.. code:: python

   starting_activity = 1000 * Bq
   half_life = 2 * sec
   times = np.linspace(0, 10, num=500, endpoint=True) * sec
   decay = np.log(2) / half_life
   activities = [starting_activity * np.exp(-decay * t) for t in times]
   source.tac_times = times
   source.tac_activities = activities

During the simulation, the activity of this source will be updated
according to the current simulation time with a linear interpolation of
this TAC. If the simulation time is before the first time or above the
last one in the ``times`` vector, the activity is considered as zero.
The number of elements in the ``times`` linspace (here 500) defined the
accuracy of the TAC. See example ``test052``.

.. _source-energy:

Energy
------

Mono
""""

``energy.type = "mono"`` corresponds to a single energy value to be used
for every particle.

.. code:: python

    source.energy.type = "mono"
    source.energy.mono = 1 * MeV

Range
"""""

``energy.type = "range"`` corresponds to a range of energy values between
``min_energy`` and ``max_energy`` with a uniform random distribution.

.. code:: python

    source.energy.type = "range"
    source.energy.min_energy = 3 * keV
    source.energy.max_energy = 57 * keV


Gauss
"""""

``energy.type = "gauss"`` allows to produce particles according to a
normal distribution with:

* μ = ``source.energy.mono``
* σ = ``source.energy.sigma_gauss``

.. code:: python

    source.energy.type = "gauss"
    source.energy.mono = 140 * MeV
    source.energy.sigma_gauss = 10 * MeV


Spectra
"""""""

**Discrete for gamma spectrum**

One can configure a generic source to produce particles with energies depending on weights.
To do so, one must provide two lists of the same size: one for energies, one for weights.
Each energy is associated to the corresponding weight.
Probabilities are derived from weights simply by normalizing the weights list.

Several spectra are provided through the `get_rad_gamma_spectrum` function:

.. code:: python

   spectrum = gate.sources.generic.get_rad_gamma_spectrum("Lu177")


The source can be configured like this:


.. code:: python

   source = sim.add_source("GenericSource", "source")
   source.particle = "gamma"
   source.energy.type = "spectrum_discrete"
   source.energy.spectrum_energies = spectrum.energies
   source.energy.spectrum_weights = spectrum.weights


For example, using this:

.. code:: python

   source.energy.spectrum_energies = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8]
   source.energy.spectrum_weights = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2]

The produced particles will follow this pattern:

.. image:: ../figures/generic_source_spectrum_discrete.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%


**Histogram for beta spectrum**

One can configure a generic source to produce particles with energies according to a given histogram.
Histograms are defined in the same way as `numpy`, using bin edges and histogram values.

Several spectra are provided through the `get_rad_beta_spectrum` function.
This data comes from `[doseinfo-radar] <https://www.doseinfo-radar.com/RADARDecay.html>`_ (`[direct link to the excel file] <https://www.doseinfo-radar.com/BetaSpec.zip>`_).

.. code:: python

   spectrum = gate.sources.generic.get_rad_beta_spectrum("Lu177")

The source can be configured like this:

.. code:: python

   source = sim.add_source("GenericSource", "source")
   source.particle = "e-"
   source.energy.type = "spectrum_histogram"
   source.energy.spectrum_energy_bin_edges = spectrum.energy_bin_edges
   source.energy.spectrum_weights = spectrum.weights

For example, using this (which is what you get from `get_rad_beta_spectrum("Lu177")`):

.. code:: python

   source.energy.spectrum_energy_bin_edges = [
    0.0, 0.0249, 0.0497, 0.0746, 0.0994, 0.1243, 0.1491,
    0.174, 0.1988, 0.2237, 0.2485, 0.2734, 0.2983, 0.3231,
    0.348, 0.3728, 0.3977, 0.4225, 0.4474, 0.4722, 0.497,
   ]
   source.energy.spectrum_weights = [
    0.135, 0.122, 0.109, 0.0968, 0.0851, 0.0745, 0.0657,
    0.0588, 0.0522, 0.0456, 0.0389, 0.0324, 0.0261, 0.0203,
    0.015, 0.0105, 0.00664, 0.00346, 0.00148, 0.000297,
   ]

The produced particles will follow this pattern:

**Interpolation**

Not yet available in GATE.


Predefined energy spectrum for beta+
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

There is some predefined energy spectrum of positron (e+):

.. code:: python

   source = sim.add_source('GenericSource, 'Default')
   source.particle = 'e+'
   source.energy.type = 'F18'  # F18 or Ga68 or C11 ...

It means the positrons will be generated following the (approximated)
energy spectrum of the F18 ion. Source code is
``GateSPSEneDistribution.cpp``. Energy spectrum for beta+ emitters are
available : F18, Ga68, Zr89, Na22, C11, N13, O15, Rb82. See
http://www.lnhb.fr/nuclear-data/module-lara. One example is available in
``test031``.


Confined source
---------------

There is a ``confine`` option that allows to generate particles only if
their starting position is within a given volume. See
``phantom_nema_iec_body`` in the contrib folder. Note that the source
volume MUST be larger than the volume it is confined in. Also, note that
no particle source will be generated in the daughters of the confine
volume.

All options have a default values and can be printed with
``print(source)``.

This example confines a Xe133 source within a Trd volume (see :ref:`volumes-reference-label`) named "leftLung":

.. code:: python

   myConfSource = sim.add_source("GenericSource", "myConfSource")
   myConfSource.attached_to = "leftLung"
   myConfSource.particle = "ion 54 133"
   myConfSource.position.type = "box"
   myConfSource.position.size = sim.volume_manager.volumes[myConfSource.attached_to].bounding_box_size
   myConfSource.position.confine = "leftLung"
   myConfSource.direction.type = "iso"
   myConfSource.activity = 1000 * Bq

Voxelized source
================

Description
-----------

A voxelized source can be created as follows:

.. code:: python

   source = sim.add_source('VoxelSource', 'vox')
   source.particle = 'e-'
   source.activity = 4000 * Bq
   source.image = 'an_activity_image.mhd'
   source.direction.type = 'iso'
   source.energy.mono = 100 * keV
   source.attached_to = 'my_volume_name'

This code create a voxelized source. The 3D activity distribution is
read from the given image. This image is internally normalized such that
the sum of all pixels values is 1, leading to a 3D probability
distribution. Particles will be randomly located somewhere in the image
according to this probability distribution. Note that once an activity
voxel is chosen from this distribution, the location of the particle
inside the voxel is performed uniformly. In the given example, 4 kBq of
electrons of 140 keV will be generated.

Like all objects, by default, the source is located according to the
coordinate system of its attached_to volume. For example, if the attached_to
volume is a box, it will be the center of the box. If it is a voxelized
volume (typically a CT image), it will the **center** of this image: the
image own coordinate system (ITK’s origin) is not considered here. If
you want to align a voxelized activity with a CT image that have the
same coordinate system you should compute the correct translation. This
is done by the function
:func:`gate.image.get_translation_between_images_center`. See the contrib
example ``dose_rate.py``.

Phase-Space source
==================

Description
-----------

A phase-space source reads particles properties (position, direction,
energy, etc.) from a root file and use them as events. Typically one
particle read is counted as one particle. There is an option to change
it, see Enhanced particle counting below. Here is an example to use a
phase space source:

.. code:: python

   source = sim.add_source("PhaseSpaceSource", "phsp_source")
   source.attached_to = plane.name
   source.phsp_file = "input.root"
   source.position_key = "PrePositionLocal"
   source.direction_key = "PreDirectionLocal"
   source.global_flag = False
   source.particle = "gamma"
   source.batch_size = 4000
   source.n = 20000

In that case, the key “PrePositionLocal” in the root tree file will be
used to define the position of all generated particles. The flag
“global_flag” is False so the position will be relative to the attached_to
volume (the plane here) ; otherwise, position is considered as global
(in the world coordinate system).

Limitation: the particle timestamps is NOT read from the phsp and not
considered (yet)

Particle type
-------------

The particle type can be set by ``source.particle = "proton"`` option.
Using this option all generated particles will be for example protons,
overriding the particle type specified in the phase space.

Alternatively, by setting ``source.particle = None`` the particle type
is read from the phase space file using the PDGCode.
``source.PDGCode_key = PDGCode`` specifies the name of the entry in the
phase space file. Full listing:

.. code:: python

   source.PDGCode_key = "PDGCode"
   source.particle = None

The PDGCode is defined by the particle data group (see
https://pdg.lbl.gov/2023/web/viewer.html?file=../reviews/rpp2022-rev-monte-carlo-numbering.pdf).
Here is a short overview of common particle types and its corresponding
PDG Code

::

   proton: 2212
   neutron: 2211
   electron: 11
   gamma: 22
   carbon ion C12: 1000060120

Naming of the phase space file keys
-----------------------------------

The naming of the phsp file entries generated by e.g. a GATE phase space
actor changed over time, most notably from GATE v9 to GATE v10. Setting
``source.position_key = "PrePositionLocal"`` will cause the phsp source
to look for particle positions in
``PrePositionLocal_X, PrePositionLocal_Y, PrePositionLocal_Z``.
``source.direction_key = "PreDirectionLocal"`` will do the corresponding
for the particle direction vector components in
``PreDirectionLocal_X, PreDirectionLocal_y, PreDirectionLocal_Z``.

It is possible to directly set the individual keys of the phase space
file:

::

   source.position_key = None"PrePositionLocal"
   source.position_key_x = Position_X"
   source.position_key_y = Position_X
   source.position_key_z = Position_X
   source.direction_key = None
   source.direction_key_x = Direction_X
   source.direction_key_y = Direction_X
   source.direction_key_z = Direction_X
   source.energy_key = "KineticEnergy"
   source.weight_key = "Weight"
   source.PDGCode_key = "PDGCode"

Source rotation and translation
-------------------------------

The starting position and direction from each particle is read from the
phase space field. It is possible to shift the origin as well as rotate
the source.

::

   source.translate_position = False
   source.rotate_direction = False
   source.position.translation = [0, 0, 0]
   source.position.rotation = Rotation.identity().as_matrix()

If translate_position is set to true, the source.position.translation is
evaluated and translates the starting point of the particles by this
vector. If rotate_direction is set to true, the source.position.rotation
is evaluated to rotate the initial particle vectors. It can be set using
the code below, resulting in a rotation of 30 degrees around the x axis.

::

   from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation
   rotation = Rotation.from_euler("x", [30], degrees=True)
   source.position.rotation = rotation.as_matrix()

Enhanced particle counting - realistic particle mix
---------------------------------------------------

In case of simulating a realistic particle mix, for example the output
after a linac, a phsp file could contain a mixture of particles.
Typically, one would be interested in simulating a given number of
primary particles (e.g. protons), simulating, but not counting as
secondary particles (e.g. secondary electrons) in the number of
particles to simulate. This can be achieved by setting
``generate_until_next_primary = True``. Furthermore, the PDG code of the
primary particle needs to be specified, as well as a lower energy
threshold (in order to identify secondary particles of the same type as
the primary particle). The example below will consider protons above 90
MeV as primary particles. Every primary particle found in the phsp file
will increase the number of particles simulated counter, while secondary
particles (e.g. all other particles in the phsp file) will be simulated,
but not be considered in (e.g. not increasing) the number of particles
simulated.

::

   source.generate_until_next_primary = True
   source.primary_lower_energy_threshold = 90.0 * MeV
   source.primary_PDGCode = 2212

Multithreading - where to start reading in a phase space file
-------------------------------------------------------------

For multithread: you need to indicate the ``entry_start`` for all
threads, as an array, so that each thread starts in the phsp file at a
different position. This done for example as follows (see
``test019_linac_phsp_source_MT.py``). Warning, if the phsp reach its
end, it will cycle and start back at the beginning.

.. code:: python

   total_nb_of_particle = 1e6
   nb_of_threads = 4
   source.entry_start = [total_nb_of_particle * p for p in range(nb_of_threads)]

See all test019 and test060 as examples.

GAN sources (Generative Adversarial Network)
============================================

Description
-----------

A Phase-Space (phsp) source typically uses a large file containing particle properties (e.g., energy, position, direction, time) to generate primary events in a simulation. This traditional phsp source can be replaced by a neural network-based particle generator that replicates similar distribution probabilities in a more compact form. GAN sources utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained to reproduce these particle properties based on an initial phsp. This approach, proposed in `[Sarrut et al, PMB, 2019] <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab3fc1/>`__, can be applied across various applications:

- Linac phsp: `test034 <https://github.com/OpenGATE/opengate/tree/master/opengate/tests/src>`_ `[Sarrut et al, PMB, 2019] <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab3fc1>`__
- SPECT: `test038 <https://github.com/OpenGATE/opengate/tree/master/opengate/tests/src>`_ and `test047 <https://github.com/OpenGATE/opengate/tree/master/opengate/tests/src>`_ `[Sarrut et al, PMB, 2021] <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abde9a>`_ and `[Saporta et al, PMB, 2022] <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/aca068>`_
- PET: `test040 <https://github.com/OpenGATE/opengate/tree/master/opengate/tests/src>`_ `[Sarrut et al, PMB, 2023] <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/acdfb1>`_

Installation Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use GAN sources, first install the required `torch` and `gaga_phsp` libraries with:

.. code:: bash

    pip install torch gaga_phsp

The `gaga_phsp` library provides tools for training and using GAN models: https://github.com/OpenGATE/gaga-phsp.

Workflow Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The workflow to use a GAN source involves three main steps:

1. Generate the training dataset.
2. Train the GAN model.
3. Use the GAN model as a source in GATE.

For Linac applications, a conventional Linac phsp can serve as the training dataset. In SPECT or PET applications, a conditional GAN is used to generate particles exiting the patient, conditioned on the activity distribution within the patient. In this case, the training dataset must include not only the particle properties at the patient exit (e.g., position and direction in a spheroid or cylinder around the patient) but also the initial emission point inside the patient (using `EventPosition` and `EventDirection`). An example can be found in `test038_gan_phsp_spect_training_dataset_mt.py`.

Training the GAN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the training data is generated, train the GAN model outside of GATE using `gaga_phsp`. Example command:

.. code:: bash

    gaga_train my_phsp.root gaga_train_options.json -pi epoch 50 -o gan_source.pth

A sample JSON file for GAN options, `train_gaga_v124.json`, can be found in the `tests/data/test038` folder. Training can be resource-intensive, typically requiring a GPU and several hours. The resulting generator model is saved as a compact `.pth` file, containing the neural network weights (generally a few tens of MB).

Using the GAN Source in GATE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once trained, the generator can be used as a source in GATE using the ``GANSource`` type, as in the example below:

.. code:: python

    gsource = sim.add_source("GANSource", "my_gan_source")
    gsource.particle = "gamma"
    gsource.activity = 1 * MBq
    gsource.pth_filename = "gan_source.pth"

    gsource.position_keys = ["PrePosition_X", "PrePosition_Y", "PrePosition_Z"]
    gsource.direction_keys = ["PreDirection_X", "PreDirection_Y", "PreDirection_Z"]
    gsource.energy_key = "KineticEnergy"
    gsource.time_key = None
    gsource.weight_key = None

    gsource.energy_min_threshold = 10 * keV
    gsource.backward_distance = 5 * cm
    # Use ZeroEnergy policy to avoid altering event counts
    gsource.skip_policy = "ZeroEnergy"

    gsource.batch_size = 5e4
    gsource.verbose_generator = True
    gsource.gpu_mode = "auto"

    cond_gen = gate.sources.gansources.VoxelizedSourceConditionGenerator("myactivity.mhd")
    cond_gen.compute_directions = True
    gen = gate.sources.gansources.GANSourceConditionalGenerator(gsource, cond_gen.generate_condition)
    source.generator = gen

In this example, the GAN source emits 10 MBq of gamma particles with position and direction distributions learned by the GAN. Each attribute of the particles (e.g., position, direction, energy) corresponds to a key in the GAN file. The `energy_min_threshold` parameter defines a lower limit for energy; particles with energy below this threshold can either be skipped (`skip_policy = "SkipEvents"`) or assigned zero energy (`skip_policy = "ZeroEnergy"`), meaning they are not tracked.

The GAN operates in batches, with the size defined by `batch_size`. In this case, a conditional GAN is used to control the emitted particles based on an internal activity distribution provided by a voxelized source (`myactivity.mhd` file). This approach can efficiently replicate complex spatial dependencies in the particle emission process.

The GAN-based source is an experimental feature in GATE. While it offers promising advantages in terms of reduced file size and simulation speed, users are encouraged to approach it cautiously. We strongly recommend thoroughly reviewing the associated publications `[Sarrut et al, PMB, 2019] <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab3fc1>`_, `[Sarrut et al, PMB, 2021] <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abde9a>`_, and `[Saporta et al, PMB, 2022] <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/aca068>`_ to understand the method’s assumptions, limitations, and best practices. This method is best suited for research purposes and may not yet be appropriate for clinical or regulatory applications without extensive validation.

PHID source (Photon from Ion Decay)
===================================

Description
-----------


PHID (Photon from Ion Decay) is a virtual source model that generates
photons emitted in the complex decay chain process of alpha-emitter
radionuclides, typically for use during simulation of SPECT image
acquisition. Given an alpha-emitter radionuclide, the model extracts
from Geant4 databases the photon emission lines from all decaying
daughters for both isometric transition and atomic relaxation processes.
According to a given time range, abundances and activities in the decay
chain are considered thanks to the Bateman equations, taking into
account the decay rates and the initial abundances. It generates photons
with the correct energy and temporal distribution, avoiding the costly
Monte Carlo simulation of the complete decay chain. Photons emitted from
Bremsstrahlung are ignored, but are not significant for SPECT imaging.
Also, the model is not expected to be correct for gammas below 20-30
keV.

See `Sarrut et al 2024 Phys. Med. Biol. <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ad3881>`_.

To use such a source, declare a “PhotonFromIonDecaySource” with an ion
as particle name, like the “GenericSource”. Only the gammas emitted by
atomic relaxation and isomeric transition will be created and tracked.
The timing is taken into account by using a TAC (Time Activity Curve)
automatically computed from the start and end time of the simulation.
The TAC is then binned and the number of bins can be modified. See tests
053.

.. code:: python

   source = sim.add_source("PhotonFromIonDecaySource", "my_source")
   source.particle = f"ion 89 225"
   source.position.type = "sphere"
   source.position.radius = 1 * nm
   source.direction.type = "iso"
   source.activity = 10 * kBq
   source.atomic_relaxation_flag = True
   source.isomeric_transition_flag = True
   source.tac_bins = 200
   source.dump_log = "phid_log.txt"
   source.verbose = True

Command line tools
------------------

Also, several command lines tools are provided :

.. code:: bash

   # print information about a radionuclide bi213, pb212, etc.
   phid_info ac225

   # plot time activity curve of a radionuclide. Options may by set to adapt the timing
   phid_tac

   # plot gammas lines from a radionuclide (whatever the time)
   phid_gammas ac225
   phid_atomic_relaxation ac225
   phid_isomeric_transition ac225

Ion Pencil Beam Source
======================

Description
-----------

The :class:`~.opengate.sources.beamsources.IonPencilBeamSource` inherits from the :class:`~.opengate.sources.generic.GenericSource` and retains
therefore the same input parameters. The main difference consists in the
sampling of the position and direction of the particles, which are not
sampled independently, but are correlated. In fact, the Pencil Beam
source is meant to describe a beam that can converge or diverge. This
behaviour is modeled according to the Fermi-Eyges theory (Techniques of
Proton Radiotherapy: Transport Theory B. Gottschalk May 1, 2012), that
describes the correlated momentum spread of the particle with 4
parameters (each for x and y direction, assuming a beam directed as z):

- spot size 𝜎
- divergence 𝜃
- emittance 𝜀
- convergence flag [1,0]

The parameters must satisfy the condition:

.. code:: python

   pi * sigma * theta >= epsilon

.. figure:: https://github.com/OpenGATE/opengate/assets/74096483/8b3d2077-b9e8-4d39-b027-3fa2089b597d

The user can set the beam parameters as shown in the example below, for
a 120 MeV/n carbon ion beam.

.. code:: python

   source = sim.add_source("IonPencilBeamSource", "mysource")
   source.energy.mono = 1440 * MeV
   source.particle = "ion 6 12"  # carbon
   source.position.translation = [100 * mm, 0 * mm, 0 * cm]
   source.n = 20000
   source.direction.partPhSp_x = [
       2.3335754 * mm,
       2.3335754 * mrad,
       0.00078728 * mm * mrad,
       0,
   ]
   source.direction.partPhSp_y = [
       1.96433431 * mm,
       0.00079118 * mrad,
       0.00249161 * mm * mrad,
       0,
   ]

.. note:: The Pencil Beam source is created by default directed as the positive z axis. To rotate the source, use the source.position.rotation option.

Check all test044 for usage examples.

Treatment Plan Pencil Beam source
=================================

Description
-----------

In ion beam therapy, a target’s volume is irradiated by scanning a
pencil beam across the transverse plane using steering magnets, while
adjusting the beam energy to reach different depths within the target.
The Treatment Plan source simulates the delivery of a scanned ion pencil
beam treatment plan.

The treatment plan specifies, for each beam and each energy layer, the
positions (x,y) of the spots to be irradiated and their weight,
represented as either the number of particles or monitor units. Here,
the (x,y) coordinates indicate where the beam intersects the plane of
the room’s isocenter. The plan also includes the gantry angle for each
beam.

The Treatment Plan source reads the treatment plan file provided by the
user and generates a Pencil Beam source whose parameters are updated in
order to cover the spots described in the plan. To determine the
position and orientation of each pencil beam, essential beamline
geometrical parameters are required, such as the position of the
stearing magnets and the virtual source to isocenter distance. Moreover,
the beamline energy dependent optics parameters and the energy spread
should be characterized.

Note that the Treatment Plan source simulates only a single beam at a
time. If the treatment plan includes multiple beams, each must be
simulated individually. You can specify the beam to simulate by using
the “beam_nr” property of the source, with beam numbering starting at 1.

To set up a Treatment Plan source, the user shall provide:

-  a **treatment plan file path**: DICOM format or Gate 9 text file
   format. Alternatively, the user can provide a dictionary with the
   spots data (see opengate.contrib.tps.ionbeamtherapy ->
   spots_info_from_txt).
-  a **beamline model**: including geometrical and energy dependent
   parametrs’ description. (see opengate.contrib.beamlines.ionbeamline
   -> BeamlineModel).
-  the **gantry rotation axis**. Default is ‘z’.
-  the **number of particles** to simulate.
-  the **ion type**.

Additional functionality
------------------------

-  ``flat_generation`` flag: if True, the same number of particles is
   generated for each spot and the spot weight is applied to the energy
   deposition instead. Default is False.
-  ``sorted_spot_generation`` flag: if True, the spots are irradiated
   one by one, following the order in the treatment plan. Otherwise the
   spots are selected by sampling from a probability density function.
   Default is False.

Here an example of how to set up a Treatment Plan source in the opengate
simulation:

.. code:: python

       # beamline model
       beamline = BeamlineModel()
       beamline.name = None
       beamline.radiation_types = "proton"

       # polinomial coefficients
       beamline.energy_mean_coeffs = [1, 0]
       beamline.energy_spread_coeffs = [0.4417036946562556]
       beamline.sigma_x_coeffs = [2.3335754]
       beamline.theta_x_coeffs = [2.3335754e-3]
       beamline.epsilon_x_coeffs = [0.00078728e-3]
       beamline.sigma_y_coeffs = [1.96433431]
       beamline.theta_y_coeffs = [0.00079118e-3]
       beamline.epsilon_y_coeffs = [0.00249161e-3]

       # tps
       n_sim = 80000  # particles to simulate per beam
       tps = sim.add_source("TreatmentPlanPBSource", "TPSource")
       tps.n = n_sim
       tps.beam_model = beamline
       tps.plan_path = ref_path / "TreatmentPlan2Spots.txt"
       tps.beam_nr = 1
       tps.gantry_rot_axis = "x"
       tps.sorted_spot_gneration = True
       tps.particle = "proton"
