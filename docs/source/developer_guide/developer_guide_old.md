## GATE architecture: Managers and Engines

GATE 10 has two distinct kinds of classes which handle a simulation. Managers provide an interface to the user to set-up and configure a simulation and collect and organize user parameters in a structured way. Engines provide the interface with Geant4 and are responsible for creating all Geant4 objects. Managers and engines are divided in sub-managers and sub-engines responsible for certain logical parts of a simulation. Additionally, many objects in GATE are now implemented as classes which provide interfaces to the managers and engines.

The `Simulation` class is the main manager with which the user interacts. It collects general parameters, e.g. about verbosity and visualization and it manages the way the simulation is run (in a subprocess or not). Sub-managers are: `VolumeManager`, `PhysicsManager` , `ActorManager`, `SourceManager`. These managers can be thought of as bookkeepers. For example, the `VolumeManager` keeps a dictionary with all the volumes added to a simulation, a dictionary with all the parallel world volumes, etc. But it also provides the user with methods to perform certain tasks, e.g. `VolumeManager.add_parallel_world()`.

The `SimulationEngine` is the main driver of the Geant4 simulation: every time the user calls `sim.run()`, the `Simulation` object (here assumed to be called `sim`) creates a new `SimulationEngine` which in turn creates all the sub-engines: `VolumeEngine`, `PhysicsEngine`, `SourceEngine`, `ActorEngine`, `ActionEngine`.
The method `SimulationEngine.run_engine()` actually triggers the construction and run of the Geant4 simulation. It takes the role of the `main.cc` in a pure Geant4 simulation.
When the Geant4 simulation has terminated, `SimulationEngine.run_engine()` returns the simulation output which is then collect by the `Simulation` object and remains accessible via `sim.output`.

It is important to understand that the engines only exist while the GATE/Geant4 simulation is running, while the managers exist during the entire duration of the python interpreter session in which the user is setting up the simulation.

The managers and engines are explained in more detail below.

### References among managers and engines

Managers and engines frequently need to access attributes of other managers and engines. They therefore need references to each other. In GATE, these references follow a hierarchical pattern:

- Sub-managers keep a references to the `Simulation` (the main manager). Sub-sub-managers keep references to the sub-manager above them. For example: `PhysicsManager.simulation` refers to the `Simulation` object which created it, and `PhysicsListManager.physics_manager` refers to the `PhysicsManager` which created it.
- Objects created through a manager keep a reference to the creating manager. For example: all volumes have an attribute `volume_manager`.
- In a similar fashion, sub-engines keep a references to the `SimulationEngine` from which they originate.
- The `SimulationEngine` itself keeps a reference to the `Simulation` which created it.

This hierarchical network of references allows reaching objects from any other object. For example: a `Region` object is managed by the `PhysicsManager`, so from a region, a volume can be reached via:
```python
my_volume = region.physics_manager.simulation.volume_manager.get_volume('my_volume')
```

## Geant4 bindings

This repository contains C++ source code that maps some (not all!) Geant4 classes into one single Python module. It also contains additional C++ classes that extends Geant4 functionalities (also mapped to Python). At the end of the compilation process a single Python module is available, named `opengate_core` and is ready to use from the Python side.

The source files are divided into two folders: `g4_bindings` and `opengate_lib`. The first contains pure Geant4 Python bindings allow to expose in Python a (small) part of Geant4 classes and functions. The bindings are done with the [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) library. The second folder contains specific opengate functionalities.

### How to add a Geant4 bindings ?

If you want to expose another Geant4 class (or functions), you need to:

- Create a `pyG4MyClass.cpp`
- With a function `init_G4MyClass` (see example in the `g4_bindings` folder)
- In this function, indicate all functions/members that you want to expose.
- Declare and call this init function in the `opengate_core.cpp` file.

### Misc

- Not clear if G4RunManager should be destructed at the end of the simulation. For the moment we use `py::nodelete` to prevent deletion because seg fault after the run.


## Philosophy behind objects implemented as GateObject

Generally, the idea is to encapsulate functionality into classes rather than spreading out the code across managers and engines. The advantage is that the code structure remains less cluttered. Good examples are the `Region` class and, although more complex, the volume classes. In the following, we explain the rationale and design concept. For instructions on how to implement or extend a class, see [here](#how-a-class-in-gate-10-is-usually-set-up).

The GATE classes representing and a Geant4 object (or multiple Geant4 objects combined) are meant to do multiple things:
1) Be a storage for user parameters. Exmample: the `Region` class holds the user_info `user_limits`, `production_cuts`, and `em_switches`.
2) Provide interface functions to manager classes (and the user) to configure the object or inquire about it. Examples: `Region.associate_volume()`, `Region.need_step_limiter()`
3) Provide interface functions such as `initialize()` and `close()` to the engines to handle the Geant4 objects.
4) Provide convenience functionality such as dumping as dictionary (`to_dictionary()`, `from_dictionary()`), dump info about the object (e.g. `Region.dump_production_cuts()`), clone itself.
5) Handle technical aspects such as pickling (for subprocesses) in a unified way ([via the method `__getstate__()`](#implement-a-getstate-method-if-needed))

The managers and engines, on the other hand, remain quite sleek and clean. For example, if you look at the `PhysicsEngine` class, you find the method
```python
    def initialize_regions(self):
        for region in self.physics_manager.regions.values():
            region.initialize()
```
which really just iterates over the regions and initializes them.

The advantage of this becomes evident especially if there are multiple variants of a class (via inheritance), such as for volumes. In this case, the `VolumeEngine` does not care about the specific type of volume because it always calls the same interface. For example, `VolumeEngine.Construct()` (which is triggered by the G4RunManager, not GATE) iterates over the volumes and calls `volume.construct()`. The volume object then takes care of taking the correct actions. If the code inside each volume's `construct()` method were implemented inside  `VolumeEngine.Construct()`, it would be cluttered with if statements to pick what should be done.

> **Note**\
> For now, only a part of GATE implements objects based on the GateObject base class. Actors and Sources still need to be refactored.

## How a class in GATE 10 is (usually) set up:

### Naming convention
- Use small letters and underscores for python variables. Do **not** use capital letters and camelcase.
- Use capital letters and camel case for overloaded C++ variables if the class inherits from a base class implemented in C++.
- All attributes pointing to Geant4 objects should have a “g4_” prepended for easy identification. Example: `self.g4_logical_volume`.
- Group the `g4_***` definitions in one block for better visual reference.

### `__init__()` method
- Define all attributes of the object in the `__init__()` method even if their value is set only later/elsewhere.
- If no value is set in `__init__()`, do:
  ```python
  self.my_attribute = None
  ```
- By defining all attributes in the `__init__()` method, other developers can easily inspect the class without reading through the entire class. Think of it as a C++ header file.

- If your class inherits from another class, and in particular from `GateObject` or `DynamicGateObject`, include wild card arguments and keyword arguments in your `__init__()` method:

  ```python
  def __init__(self, your_specific_arguments, *args, your_specific_kwargs, **kwargs):
      super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
      # ... YOUR CODE...
  ```

### User info: handling parameters set by the user
If your class handles user input, let it inherit from GateObject, or DynamicGateObject if applicable. Define and configure user input via the `user_info_defaults` class attribute. See section XXX.

**Important**: User input defined and configured in the `user_info_defaults` dictionary should generally not be handled manually in your `__init__()` method. They are passed on to the superclass inside the `kwargs` dictionary. See section XXX for more detail.

### Initialization of Geant4 objects
Implement an `initialize()` method if Geant4 objects need to be created by the SimulationEngine (or a sub-engine) when the simulation is launched. The `initialize()` method should not take any arguments, but only rely on object attributes (`self.xyz`) which were previously set.

Exception: G4RunManager has an initializatin sequence which GATE relies on. In certain classes, the `g4_XXX` componentes are initialized as part of this sequence on the C++ side. Example: All volumes implement a `construct()` method which is called when the G4RunManager calls the overloaded `Construct()` method of the VolumeEngine.

### Implement a `close()` method if needed
Explanation: If your class has attributes that point to Geant4 objects which are deleted by the G4RunManager at the end of a simulation, your class must get rid of these references when the SimulationEngine closes down. This is achieved by a hierarchy of calls to a close() method, starting from `SimulationEngine.close()`. In your `close()` method, set all attributes pointing to Geant4 objects which the G4RunManafger will delete to `None`. If your class manages a list of other objects which themselves need to call their `close()` method, add a loop to your `close()` method and close down the list members. If you inherit from another class, do not forget to call the `close()` method from the superclass via `super().close()`.
Take a look at `VolumeManager.close()` and the volumes classes or `PhysicsManager.close()` and the `Region` class for examples.

### Implement a `__getstate__()` method if needed.
Explanation: When a GATE simulation is run in a subprocess, all objects need to be serialized so they can be sent to the subprocess, where they are deserialized. The serialization is currently handled by the `pickle` module. If your class contains attributes which refer to objects which cannot be pickled, the serialization will fail. This typically concerns Geant4 objects. To make your class pickleable, you should implement a `__getstate__()` method. This is essentially a hook called within the serialization pipeline which returns a representation of your object (usually a dictionary). You should remove items which cannot be pickled from this dictionary.

**Example**: Assume your class has an attribute `self.g4_funny_object` referring to a Geant4 object. Your `__getstate__()` method should do something like this:

```python
def __getstate__(self):
	return_dict = self.__dict__
	return_dict['g4_funny_object'] = None
	return return_dict
```

If your class inherits from another one, e.g. from GateObject, you should call the `__getstate__()` method from the superclass:

```python
def __getstate__(self):
	return_dict = super().__getstate__()
	return_dict['g4_funny_object'] = None
	return return_dict
```

**Important**: The `__getstate__()` method should **not** change your object, but only modify the dictionary to be returned. Therefore, avoid `self.g4_funny_object = None` as this also alters your object.

Important: Do **not** use the `close()` method in your `__getstate__()` method. The `close()` method is part of [another mechanism](#implement-a-close-method-if-needed-) and these mechanisms should not be entangled. And: the `close()` method would alter your object and not only the returned dictionary representation.

### Optional: Implement a `__str__()` method
You might consider implementing a `__str__()` method which, by construction, is required to return a string. If implemented, this method is called when the user places your object inside a `print()` statement: `print(my_object)`. You could implement the `__str__()` method to provide useful information about your object. If your object inherits from another class, call the superclass:
```python
def __str__(self):
	s = super().__str__()
	s += "*** Additional info: ***\n"
	s += f"The object as an attribute 'xyz' of value {self.xyz}.\n"
	return s
```
In particular, the GateObject superclass (and variants) implement a `__str__()` method which lists all user_info of the object.

## How to implement an actor

### Mandatory basic class structure

1) Implement an `initialize()` method which should at least:

  - call the `initialize()` method from the python super class.
  - call the `InitializeCpp()` method from the C++ super class
  - call the `InitializeUserInput()` method from the C++ super class
  - If you need to perform specific checks, e.g. plausibility of user input parameters, you will probably want to do that before calling the C++ methods.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def initialize(self):
        ActorBase.initialize(self)
        # possibly implement some checks here ...
        self.InitializeUserInput(self.user_info)
        self.InitializeCpp()
    ```

2) Implement a `__initcpp__()` method. This should at least call the C++ constructor method and add actions if needed. Example:
    ```python
    def __initcpp__(self):
        g4.GateSimulationStatisticsActor.__init__(self, self.user_info)
        self.AddActions({"StartSimulationAction", "EndSimulationAction"})
    ```
    Do **not** call the C++ constructor in the python `__init__()` method. This will cause problems when a simulation is run in a subprocess. Reason: The subprocessing mechanism relies on de-/serialization and GATE expects a `__initcpp__()` method to make sure the C++ constructor is called after deserialization (see `__setstate__()` in *actors/base.py*)

3) Inherit first from the python base class and then from the C++ base class. In other words, write:
    ```python
    class SimulationStatisticsActor(ActorBase, g4.GateSimulationStatisticsActor):
    ```
    Do **not** write:
    ```python
    class SimulationStatisticsActor( g4.GateSimulationStatisticsActor, ActorBase):
    ```
4) Refer to the super class explicitly and do **not** use the `super()` builtin from python because it cannot resolve C++ super classes.


### Inheritance in actor classes
FIXME: Inherit first from python base class and then from C++ base class.

## Helpers

Error handling. Use the following to fail with an exception and trace:

```python
import opengate as gate

gate.raise_except('There is bug')
gate.exception.fatal('This is a fatal error')
gate.exception.warning('This is a warning')
```

There are several levels: `WARNING INFO DEBUG`. The last one print more information. Logging is handled with logger in `helpers_log.py`.

## Engines
As explained [above](#gate-architecture-managers-and-engines), the Engine classes drive the actual Geant4 simulation. This section explains the engines in detail.

### SimulationEngine
The `SimulationEngine` is the main engine class. Upon instantiation (i.e., in the `__init__()` method), all sub-engines are created which drive the different parts if the Geant4 simulation. The sub-engines keep a reference to the `SimulationEngine` which created them.

The three main methods of the `SimulationEngine` are `SimulationEngine.run_engine()`, `SimulationEngine.initialize()` and `SimulationEngine.start_and_stop()`, where the latter two are called by the former.
The method `SimulationEngine.run_engine()` essentially takes the role of the `main.cc` in a pure Geant4 simulation. It first initializes the simulation with `SimulationEngine.initialize()` and then starts event loop with `SimulationEngine.start_and_stop()` via the `SourceEngine`.

The `SimulationEngine` uses the `G4RunManager` via a pybind11 wrapping and many Geant4 objects are created by the `G4RunManager`. In short: The `G4RunManager` is informed about the geometry, physics, and sources via its `SetUserInitialization()` method. The Geant4 initialization procedure is then triggered by `g4_RunManager.Initialize()`, just as a regular Geant4 simulation would.
For details, please consult the Geant4 user guide.

Note that there are subtleties concerning the way the `G4RunManager` works in singlethread and multithread mode which we do not cover in this guide.

Complementary to the `g4_RunManager.Initialize()`, there are expicit calls to `initialize()` methods of the sub-engines, some of them before `g4_RunManager.Initialize()` and some afterwards.

The `SimulationEngine` is implemented as what is known in python as *context manager*. This means, in can be created in a *with-clause*: `with SimulationEngine(self) as se: ...` (see `SimulationEngine._run_simulation_engine()`). What it does is that the `SimulationEngine` object only exists as long as the commands inside the *with-clause* are executed. At the end of the *with-clause*, python calls the method `SimulationEngine.__exit__()` (like an exit hook) which triggers the method `SimulationEngine.close()`. The purpose of the `close()` method is to prepare all python objects that are part of the GATE simulation for the deletion of the `G4RunManager`. In particular, it makes sure that references to those Geant4 objects which the destructor of the `G4RunManager` will delete are set to `None`. Otherwise, segmentation faults will occur. We do not go into further detail here, but it is useful to understand this background of the `close()` mechanism triggered by the *with-clause* because you, as a developer, might need to implement a `close()` method in your class or extend the `close()` in an existing class which your are enhancing (see the section on [how a class is set up in GATE](#how-a-class-in-gate-10-is-usually-set-up-).

It is worth noting that you have probably already come across *context managers* in python elsewhere. For example, when opening a file, you typically do `with open('my_file.txt', 'w') as f: ...`. When the *with-clause* ends, python automatically calls `f.close()`, i.e. closes the IO pipeline.

## OPENGATE elements: volumes, physic, sources, actors

A simulation is composed of several elements: some volumes, some sources, some actors and some physics properties. The parameters that can be defined by the user (the person that develop the simulation) are managed by simple dict-like structure. No Geant4 objects are build until the initialization phase. This allows (relative) simplicity in the development.

### UserInfo (before initialisation)

An 'element' can be a Volume, a Source or an Actor. There are several element type that can be defined and use several time by user. For example, a BoxVolume, with element_type = Volume and type_name = Box. For all element, the user information (`user_info`) is a single structure that contains all parameters to build/manage the element (the size of a BoxVolume, the radius of a SphereVolume, the activity of a GenericSource etc). User info are stored in a dict-like
structure. This is performed through a `UserInfo` class inheriting from Box.

One single function is used to define the default keys of a given user info : `set_default_user_info`. This function must be defined as a static method in the class that define the element type (BoxVolume in the previous example).

Examples:

```python
vol = sim.add_volume('Type', 'name')        # -> vol is UserInfo
sol = sim.new_solid('Type', 'name')         # -> sol is UserInfo
src = sim.add_source('Type', 'name')        # -> src is UserInfo
act = sim.add_actor('Type', 'name')         # -> act is UserInfo
phys = sim.get_physics_user_info()          # -> phys is UserInfo
filter = sim.add_filter('Type', 'name')     # -> filter is UserInfo
```

## OPENGATE Source

Consider the test056 and the "TemplateSource" as a starting example to create a new type of source.


Main files: `SourceManager`, `SourceBase`,\`helper_sources\`, all `XXXSource.py`.

- \[py\] `SourceManager`

    - Manages all sources (GateSourceManager) and all threads.
    - `run_timing_intervals` : array of start/end time for all runs
    - `sources` : dict of `SourceBase`
    - `g4_sources` : array of `GateVSource`. Needed to avoid pointer deletion on py side
    - `g4_thread_source_managers` : array of all source managers for all threads
    - `g4_master_source_manager` : master thread source manager

- \[cpp\] `GateSourceManager`

    - Manages a list of sources.
    - `fSources` : list of all managed `GateVSource` sources
    - `initialize` : set the time intervals
    - `start_main_thread` : start the simulation, only for the main thread
    - `GeneratePrimaries` : will be called by the G4 engine.

A source type is split into two parts: py and cpp. The py part inherits from `SourceBase` and manages the user info. The
cpp part inherits from `GateVSource` and shoot the particles.

- \[py\] `SourceBase`

    - Base class for all types of source (py side)
    - Used to store the user info of the source
    - Manages the start and end time of the source
    - The `create_g4_source` function must be overloaded

- \[cpp\] `GateVSource`

    - Base class for all types of source (cpp side)
    - `GeneratePrimaries`: is the main function that will be called by the source manager
    - `PrepareNextRun` and `PrepareNextTime` must be implemented. Will be called by the SourceManager to determine when this source shoot particles.

The `SourceManager` class manages 1) all sources of particles and 2) the time associated with all runs. The sources are `SourceBase` objects that manage 1) the user properties stored in `user_info` and 2) the corresponding cpp object inheriting from `GateVSource`. The latter are created in the function `build()` by the `create_g4_source()` function and stored in the `self.g4_sources` array to avoid py pointer automatic deletion.

The `GateSourceManager` inherits from G4 `G4VUserPrimaryGeneratorAction`. It manages the generation of events from all sources. The G4 engine call the method `GeneratePrimaries` every time a event should be simulated. The current active source and time of the event is determined at this moment, the source manager choose the next source that will shoot events according to the current simulation time. There are one GateSourceManager per thread.

All sources must inherit from `SourceBase` class. It must implement the function `create_g4_source` that will build the corresponding cpp source (that inherit from `GateVSource`). The goal of the py `SourceBase` is to manage the user options of the source and pass them to the cpp side.

## OPENGATE Actors

TODO --> inheritance to allow callback ; warning cost trampoline

Actors encapsulate several Geant4 concepts. They are used as a callback from the Geant4 engine to score information or modify the default behavior of particles during a simulation. An Actor combines the Geant4 `SensitiveDetector`and `Actions` callbacks within a single concept that can perform tasks each time a `Run`, `Event`, `Track` or `Step`starts or ends in a given volume. Actors are mainly used to record parameters or information of interest calculated during the simulation, but they can also be used to act on the current particle, for example to stop tracking it.

### How to develop a new Actor ?

Warning: this is a preliminary (short) documentation at an early stage of the code (July 2022). It could be outdated.

We recommend to look at an example (e.g. `GateDoseActor` ). The main concept is to write a cpp class that will act during the simulation, and to manage all users options and parameters from the python side. Geant4 messengers are no longer used. There is a mechanism, explained below, in order to convert python options to cpp options. Writing a new actor (a kind of scorer) involves 4 steps.

#### 1 - Create a c++ class `GateMyActor`

In a file `GateMyActor.cpp`, Within the `core/opengate_core/opengate_lib/` folder. This class should inherit from `GateVActor` and implement the virtual functions that are triggered by Geant4 engine when Run, Event, Track or Step start or end. Here are the list of functions:

- `StartSimulationAction` : called when the simulation starts, only by the master thread
- `BeginOfRunAction` : called every time a Run starts (all worker threads)
- `BeginOfEventAction` : called every time an Event starts (all worker threads)
- `PreUserTrackingAction` : called every time a Track starts (all worker threads)
- `SteppingAction` : called every time a step occurs in the volume attached to the actor
- `PostUserTrackingAction` : called every time a Track ends (all worker threads)
- `EndOfEventAction`: called every time an Event ends (all worker threads)
- `EndOfRunAction`: called every time a Run ends (all worker threads)
- `EndOfSimulationWorkerAction`: called when the simulation ends, only by the workers threads
- `EndSimulationAction` : called when the simulation ends, only by the master thread

Those functions are only triggered if the actions is registered. This is done by appending the name of the actions in the `fActions` vector (see below). User options or parameters will come from the Python. It is recommended to put only the minimal set of users options in this class, stored in one single python dictionary called `user_info`. You can retrieve this dict from a parameter of the constructor of the actor, and parse it thanks to function in `GateHelpersDict.h`.

```cpp
GateMyActor::GateMyActor(py::dict &user_info) : GateVActor(user_info) {
    // Actions enabled for this actor
    fActions.insert("SteppingAction");
    fActions.insert("BeginOfRunAction");
    fActions.insert("EndSimulationAction");

    // Options
    fOutputFilename = DictGetStr(user_info, "output");
    fMyFlag = DictGetBool(user_info, "flag");
}
```

#### 2 - Expose this class to python side

This is done by creating a cpp file `pyGateMyActor.cpp`, look at `pyGateDoseActor.cpp` as example. This file contains one unique function (called `init_GateMyActor`) that indicates what are the member functions or variables that should be exposed to python. Most of the time, there are very few elements, or none. The constructor is however mandatory. The exposed functions could then be called from the python side.

This function must be declared in the `core/opengate_core.cpp` file (defined at the beginning and called within the main function).

#### 3 - Create a python file `MyActor.py` with the corresponding python class

This file must contain one class  `MyActor`, inheriting from 2 classes: 1) the cpp class you just wrote in the previous step, `g4.GamMyActor` and 2) the python `gate.ActorBase` class. The  `MyActor` class must implement:

- `set_default_user_info(user_info)` that will initialize all options of the user_info dictionary. All options must be indicated here.
- `__init__(self, user_info)` the constructor, that must call the two constructors of the mother classes
- `initialize` that will be called during initialization

```python
class DoseActor(g4.GateMyActor, gate.ActorBase):

    def set_default_user_info(user_info):
        gate.ActorBase.set_default_user_info(user_info)
        # required user info, default values
        user_info.output = 'default.txt'
        user_info.flag = False

    def __init__(self, user_info):
        gate.ActorBase.__init__(self, user_info)
        g4.GateMyActor.__init__(self, user_info.__dict__)

    def initialize(self):
        gate.ActorBase.initialize(self)

    def StartSimulationAction(self):
        g4.GateMyActor.StartSimulationAction(self)
        print('optional')

    def EndSimulationAction(self):
        g4.GateMyActor.EndSimulationAction(self)

    # etc
```

Finally, the new actor must be declared in the `opengate/actor/helpers_actor.py` file.

#### 4 - Conclusion

A new actor is defined by two interconnected classes, one in cpp, one in python. User options and parameters are stored in one single dictionary object, build from python side, and read from cpp side. If the user options is complicated, with numerous options and parameters, it is recommended to manage it from python side and only consider a unique minimal set of required options on the cpp side. Reading input and writing output are generally performed on python side.

## Notes for developers

### Pybind11 hints

Below are a list of hints (compared to boost-python).

- <https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/Porting-to-PyBind11---common-steps>
- bases is not any longer required. Only its template argument must remain, in the same position of what was there before.
- The noncopyable template argument should not be provided (everything is noncopyable unless specified) - if something is to be made copyable, a copy constructor should be provided to python
- return policies, see
  <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/functions.html>
- `return_value_policy<reference_existing_object>` --> `py::return_value_policy::reference`
- `return_internal_reference<>()` --> `py::return_value_policy::reference_internal`
- `return_value_policy<return_by_value>()` --> `py::return_value_policy::copy`
- `add_property` --> `.def_readwrite`
- Overloading methods, i.e.: `py::overload_cast<G4VUserPrimaryGeneratorAction*>(&G4RunManager::SetUserAction))`
- Pure virtual need a trampoline class <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/classes.html>
- Python debug: `python -q -X faulthandler`


### Memory managment between Python and Geant4 - Why is there a segmentation fault?

Code and memory (objects) can be on the python and/or C++(Geant4)-side.
To avoid memory leakage, the G4 objects need to be deleted at some point, either by the C++-side, meaning G4, or by the garbage collector on the python-side. This requires some understanding of how lifetime is managed in G4. GATE 10 uses the G4RunManager to initialize, run, and deconstruct a simulation. The G4RunManager's destructor triggers a nested sequence of calls to the destructors of many objects the run manager handles, e.g. geometry and physics. These objects, if they are created on the python-side, e.g. because the Construct() method is implemented in python, should never be deleted on the python-side because the G4RunManager is responsible for deletion and segfaults occur if the objects exist now longer at the time of supposed destruction. In this case, the no `py::nodelete` option in pybind11 is the correct way.

​
​There is also the python-side concerning objects which are deleted by the G4RunManager: If python stores a reference to the object, and it generally should (see below), this reference will not find the object anymore once the G4RunManager has been deleted. Therefore, we have implemented a mechanism which makes sure that references to G4 objects are unset before the G4RunManager is garbage collected (and thus its destructor is called). This is done via the close() and release_g4_references() methods combined with a `with SimulationEngine as se` context clause.
​

​The situation is somewhat different for objects that are not automatically deleted by the Geant4 session. This concerns objects which a G4 user would manually destruct and delete. The "user", from a G4 perspective, is the python-side of GATE, specifically the SimulationEngine, which creates and controls the G4RunManager. The objects in question should be destroyed on the python side, and in fact they (normally) are via garbage collection. To this end, they should **not** be bound with the `py::nodelete` option - which would prevent garbage collection. ​

In any case, G4 objects created on the python-side should not be destroyed (garbage collected) too early, i.e. not before the end of the G4 simulation, to avoid segfaults when G4 tries to a find the object to which it holds a pointer. It is important to note here that garbage collection in python is strongly tied to reference counting, meaning, objects may be garbage collected as soon as there are no more references pointing to them. Or in other words: you can prevent garbage collection by keeping a reference. In practice: If you create a G4 object that is required to persist for the duration of the simulation and you create this object in a local scope, e.g. in a function, you need to make sure to store a reference somewhere so that it lives beyond the local scope. Otherwise, when the function goes out of scope, the local reference no longer exists and the G4 object may be garbage collected. This is the reason why GATE 10 stores references to G4 objects in class attributes, either as plane reference, or via lists or dictionaries. A nasty detail: in case of a G4 object that is only referenced locally (implementation error), the moment when the segfault occurs might vary because garbage collection in python is typically scheduled (for performance reasons), meaning objects are collected any time after their last reference is released, but not necessarily at that moment. This can cause a seeming randomness in the segfaults.

​
​So, after a long explanation, the key points are:

#. check the nature of your G4 object

​#. if it is designed to be deleted by the G4RunManager, add the `py::no_delete` option in the pybind11 binding

​#. In any case, make sure to store a non-local persistent reference on the python-side, ideally as a class attribute

#. add a “release statement” in the release_g4_references() method for each G4 reference (strictly only to RunManager-handled objects, but it does not hurt for others) in the class, and make sure the release_g4_references() method is called by the class’s close() method.

An example may be the implementation of the Tesselated Volume (STL).

Pybindings in pyG4TriangularFacet.cpp:

``py::class_<G4TriangularFacet, G4VFacet>(m, "G4TriangularFacet")``
will cause a segmentation fault

``py::class_<G4TriangularFacet,  G4VFacet, std::unique_ptr<G4TriangularFacet, py::nodelete>>(m, "G4TriangularFacet")``
will work as python is instructed not to delete the object.

On the python-side in geometry/solids.py:

```python
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    self.g4_solid = None
    self.g4_tessellated_solid = None
    self.g4_facets = None
```

All data which is sent to Geant4 is included as a variable to the class. As such, it is only deleted at the end of the simulation, not when the function ends.
Which, would cause a segmentation fault.



### ITK

- The following [issue](https://github.com/OpenGATE/opengate/issues/216) occured in the past and was solved by updating ITK:
test058_calc_uncertainty_MT.py was failing because of a TypeError raised by ITK. Specifically:
`TypeError: in method 'itkImageIOFactory_CreateImageIO', argument 1 of type 'char const *'`
After updating ITK (via pip) from 5.2.1.post1 to 5.3.0, the error is gone.
If you get a similar error, try updating ITK first, by
``pip install itk --upgrade``

- Here is another [ITK-related issue](https://github.com/OpenGATE/opengate/issues/232) that has occured in the past:
The following exception was raised while trying to run test015_iec_phantom_1.py:
``module 'itk' has no attribute 'ChangeInformationImageFilter'``.
This kind of issue is also documented in ITK's issue tracker:
https://discourse.itk.org/t/changeinformationimagefilter-missing-from-pip-installed-itk-5-3rc4post3/5375

    Solution:
    1) Uninstall ITK
    2) Manually remove all traces of ITK from your python environment
    3) re-install ITK

    For me, this was:
    ```
    pip uninstall itk
    rm -r /Users/nkrah/.virtualenvs/opengate/lib/python3.9/site-packages/itk*
    pip install --upgrade --pre itk
    ```

### Geant4 seems to be frozen/sleeping - the GIL is to blame - here is why

This is taken from Issue #145 which is now closed.

So here is what happened to me: While working on a branch, I implemented an alternative binding of the G4MTRunManager. The binding includes the function G4MTRunManager::Initialize(). The naïve implementation is:

      .def("Initialize", &G4MTRunManager::Initialize)

When I tried to run a test with threads>1, Geant4 simply stopped at some point, namely when geometry and physics list were apparently set up. No error, no segfault, no further output, no CPU load, just frozen. Umpf. After a scattering cout's through the Geant4 source could, I understood the problem, and why others, like David S, had used a smarter, less naïve binding of the Initialize() function.

Here is what went wrong: G4MTRunManager::Initialize() function first calls the single thread G4RunManager::Initialize() and then does a fake run by calling BeamOn(0); The argument n–event=zero is internally interpreted as fake run and not all steps are performed as would be in a real BeamOn(). The purpose of the fake run is to set-up the worker run managers. BeamOn(0) does trigger G4RunManager::DoEventLoop() and this in turn triggers G4MTRunManager::InitializeEventLoop (the overridden version from the inherited G4MTRunManager!). At the very end, after creating and starting workers, there is a WaitForReadyWorkers(); This function contains beginOfEventLoopBarrier.Wait(GetNumberActiveThreads()); which essentially waits until all workers release locks. Specifically, it triggers a call to G4MTBarrier::Wait() which contains a while(true) loop to repeatedly check the number of locks on the shared resource, and breaks the loop when the number of locks equals the number of threads.

Now, admittedly, I do not understand every detail here, but it is clear that Geant4’s implementation relies on locks to establish whether workers are ready. So when my simulation_engine (i.e., Gate internally) called g4_RunManager.Initialize(), it ended up stuck in the while loop waiting for the locks to decrease, which never happened. Why?

This is where the so-called Global Interpreter Lock comes into play. Read this to understand the details: https://realpython.com/python-gil/, or don’t if you are smarter than I am. Essentially, at least in the CPython implementation, there is a lock (mutex) on all resources linked to the python interpreter. Historically, the GIL was a pragmatic choice to easily integrate C-extensions into python even if they were not thread-safe. What does that have to do with Gate? Well, many objects such as physics lists, are created in python, and then communicated to the Geant4 RunManager (e.g. via SetUserInitializaition). There is thus a lock on these resources, namely the GIL. The multithread mechanism in Geant4, on the other hand, does not know about the GIL and thus cannot account for this additional lock, so the lock counter never decreases sufficiently to satisfy Geant4. A way to resolve this dilemma, without hacking around in the Geant4 code, is to instruct pybind to release the Global Interpreter Lock within the scope of the call to a C++ function, such as Initialize(). One way to achieve this is to replace the naïve

```
.def("Initialize", &G4MTRunManager::Initialize)
```

by
```
      .def("Initialize",
           [](G4MTRunManager *mt) {
             py::gil_scoped_release release;
             mt->Initialize();
           })
```
The key here is the “py::gil_scoped_release release” statement. It instructs pybind to release the GIL before calling the function Initialize(). There is actually a useful passage in pybind’s doc: https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/misc.html

I think, in the case of Gate/Geant4, it is safe to release the GIL because we know that Geant4 handles shared resources in a thread-safe way. Quite the contrary: the GIL actually breaks G4’s mechanism.

So what I learned from this: Any Geant4 function which relies on Geant4’s MT mechanism based on locks needs to be bound to python with a “py::gil_scoped_release release” statement as above. The serial version G4RunManager::Initialize() does not need this statement (and should not have it) because it does not check locks at any point.
