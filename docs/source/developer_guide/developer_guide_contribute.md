# How to contribute (for developers)

We are really happy if you want to propose a new feature or changes in GATE. Please contact us and share your ideas with us - this is how Gate was born and how it will keep growing!

## Propose a pull request:
1)  Fork the opengate repository into your own github.
2)  Create a branch for the feature you want to contribute, starting from the current opengate master branch.
3)  Start implementing your ideas in your newly created branch (locally) and keep committing changes as you move forward.
4)  Prefer several small commits with clear comments over huge commits involving many files and changes.
5)  Push changes to your github repo. Also pull changes from the upstream/master (opengate's master branch) regularly to stayed synced.
6)  When you go to the branch in your repository on github, you will have the option to create a Pull Request (PR). Please do that - even if you are not done yet. You can mark a pull request as `draft`.
7)  We will then see your branch as PR in the opengate repository and can better understand what you are working on, and help you out if needed.
8)  Ideally, go to the opengate repository and open your own pull request. You should see a checkbox below on the right side saying "Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers". Please tick it. In this way, we can directly commit changes into your branch - of course we'll be in touch with you.

## Tests and documentation
It is important to make sure that Gate keeps working consistently and that simulation outcome is reliable as we keep developing the code. Therefore, we have a large set of tests which are regularly run. If you propose new features or make changes to the inner workings of Gate, please create a little test simulation that goes with it. It should be imlpemented in such a way that it checks whether the feature works as expected. This might be a check of Geant4 parameters, e.g. if production cuts are set correctly, or based on simulation outcome, such as a dose maps or a particle phase space. Best is to look at the folder `tests` in the source code.


Your test will also serve other users as example on how the new feature is used.


There is a set of functions useful for tests in `opengate/tests/utility.py` which you can, e.g., import as

```python
from opengate.tests import utility
```

Finally, please write up some lines of documentation, both for the user and/or the developer.


## Code formatting
We provide a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce code format. In order to use it, you can install it with:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
# then move to the opengate folder and do:
pre-commit install
```

Do not worry, if you forget to install it - you/we will see the error during the automatic testing (Continuous Integration) in Github and can fix it then through another commit.
