# Installation for developers

The source code is divided into two main modules, one in C++, the second in Python. The first module is used to access the Geant4 engine and for the tasks that demand speed during the run of a simulation. The second module manages user interface (the way an user create a simulation) and most tasks performed at initialization (before the run).

- `opengate_core` (C++) contains C++ Geant4 bindings and a C++ library that uses Geant4. The two components form a single Python module called `opengate_core` that can interact with Geant4 library and expose to Python functions and classes. Sources: [opengate_core](https://github.com/OpenGATE/opengate/tree/master/core)
- `opengate` (Python) is the main Python module that form the interface to the user.

## Virtual environment

:warning: It is highly, highly, *highly* recommended to create a python environment prior to the installation, for example with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv).

:warning: If you use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#) instead to create your environment, be sure to instruct conda to install python when creating your environment. You do so by adding 'python' after the new environment name. Optionally, you can select a specific python version by adding '=3.XX'.

Example: You can create a new conda environment with Python 3.10 installed in it via:

```bash
  conda create --name opengate_env python=3.10
  conda activate opengate_env
```

To **develop** in GATE 10, you need 1) to compile and create the `opengate_core` subpackage (this is the hardest part) and 2) install the main  `opengate` package (Python only, fast and easy).

First, clone the unique repository that contains both packages:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OpenGATE/opengate
```

Note that you also need to clone the included subpackages (pybind11, all data for tests etc). If you forget the `--recurse-submodules`, you can still use `git submodule update --init --recursive` after the clone.

The subpackage `opengate_core` depends on the ITK and Geant4 libraries. Therefore, you first need to download and compile both [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch) and [ITK](https://itk.org). Note: In the user install, this step is not necessary because Geant4 and ITK are shipped pre-compiled via pip.

## STEP 1 - Geant4 and Qt

:warning: When using conda, be sure to activate your environment before compiling Geant4. The reason is that conda comes with its own compiler and you will likely have mismatched libraries, e.g. lib c++, if not all installation steps involving compilaton are performed in the same conda environment.

Installing QT is optional. Currently, QT visualisation is not working on all architectures.

If you wish to use QT, you must install qt5 **before** installing Geant4 so that Geant4 can find the correct qt lib. It can be done for example with conda:

```bash
  conda install qt=5
```

For **Geant4**, you need to compile with the following options:

```bash
git clone --branch v11.2.1 https://github.com/Geant4/geant4.git --depth 1
mkdir geant4.11-build
cd geant4.11-build
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-std=c++17 \
      -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON \
      -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATADIR=$HOME/software/geant4/data \
      -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON \
      -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON \
      -DGEANT4_BUILD_MULTITHREADED=ON \
      ../geant4
make -j 32
```

Change the QT flag (GEANT4_USE_QT) to OFF if you did not install QT.

WARNING : since June 2024, [Geant4 11.2.1](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/download/11.2.1.html) is needed.

## STEP 2 - ITK

**WARNING** When using conda, be sure to activate your environment before compiling Geant4. The reason is that conda comes with its own compiler and you will likely have mismatched libraries, e.g. lib c++, if not all installation steps involving compilaton are performed in the same conda environment.


For **ITK**, you need to compile with the following options:

```bash
git clone --branch v5.2.1 https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK.git --depth 1
mkdir itk-build
cd itk-build
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-std=c++17 \
      -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF \
      -DITK_USE_FFTWD=ON \
      -DITK_USE_FFTWF=ON \
      -DITK_USE_SYSTEM_FFTW:BOOL=ON \
      ../ITK
make -j 32
```

## STEP 3 - `opengate_core` module (cpp bindings)

Once it is done, you can compile `opengate_core`.

```bash
pip install colored
cd <path-to-opengate>/core
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path-to>/geant4.11-build/:<path-to>/itk-build/:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}
pip install -e . -v
```

The pip install will run cmake, compile the sources and create the module. If you are curious you can have a look the compilation folder in the `build/` folder.

## STEP 4 - `opengate` module (python)

The second part is easier : just go in the main folder and pip install:

```bash
cd <path-to-opengate>
pip install -e . -v
```

## STEP 5 - Before running

When you want to execute some simulations on some Linux architectures, you can encounter this kind of error:

```bash
<...>/libG4particles.so: cannot allocate memory in static TLS block
```

In such a case, in the same terminal and before to run a python script, export this line:

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD=<path to libG4processes>:<path to libG4geometry>:${LD_PRELOAD}
```

Note that this is not the case on all Linux architectures, only some (we don't know why).

Then, you can run the tests with:

```bash
opengate_tests
```

**Optional**

Some tests (e.g. test034) needs [gaga-phsp](https://github.com/dsarrut/gaga-phsp) which needs [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) that cannot really be automatically installed by the previous pip install (at least we don't know how to do). So, in order to run those tests, you will have to install both pytorch and gaga-phsp
first with:

```bash
pip install torch
pip install gaga-phsp
pip install garf
```
